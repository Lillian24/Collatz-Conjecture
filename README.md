# 3x+1 aka *Collatz-Conjecture*

The Collatz-Conjecture is one of the most arduous unsolvable math problem in the world, One that young mathematicians are warned not to waste their time on.
This problem is also known as _Ulam conjecture,  Kakutani's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Hasse's algorithm, Syracuse problem_ or simply the _3n+1_.

**_"Mathematics is not yet ripe enough for such questions"_** - Paul Erdős

This is a simple conjecture but this hasn't been solved by anyone in the world so far. Eventhen many are tempted to fall into this trap.
This problem is simply stated, easily understood, and all too inviting. Just pick a number, any number: If the number is even, cut it in half; if it’s odd, triple it and add 1. Take that new number and repeat the process, again and again. If you keep this up, you’ll eventually get stuck in a loop. At least, that’s what we think will happen.
